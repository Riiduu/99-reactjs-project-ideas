The objective of this project is to create a simple clone of the popular game "Flappy Bird" using ReactJS. 
The game will involve a bird that the player can control by clicking or pressing a key to make it "flap" and rise. 
The goal is to navigate through an endless series of obstacles (pipes) without hitting them.


Features -- 

Game Area: A defined game area where the bird can fly.

Bird Movement: The bird should move up when the player clicks or presses a key and fall due to gravity when no action is taken.

Pipes: A series of vertically aligned pipes with a gap that the bird must pass through.

Collision Detection: Detect collisions between the bird and the pipes or the ground.

Scoring: Keep track of the score based on the number of pipes successfully passed.

Game Over: End the game and show the final score when a collision occurs.

Restart: Option to restart the game after it ends.
